			<p>A secured marketplace allowing you to exchange your CSGO goodies for real life money.</p>

			<p><b>OPSkins</b> allows its users to trade their Counter-Strike: Global Offensive goodies (skins) for real money,
				in a secure marketplace environment. The idea behind such a project is to put an end to all of the scams
				happening around. We have been closely following our competitors releases,
				but after months of empty promises, we have decided to fill the gap ourselves.
				The team behind OPSkins is passionate and composed of experienced entrepreneurs,
				UI designers and developers. Please head over to the help section to see how it all works.</p>
